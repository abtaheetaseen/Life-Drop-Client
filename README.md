# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

JavaScript and React are mainly used for client-side development, and for server-side scripting, Node.js and MongoDB are used. Donors can find blood donation requests in their local region and get in touch with the recipients.

If you want to run this project locally you need to ensure some steps:
1. Click the green "Code" button and copy the URL.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run this command: git clone <repo url>
4. To install dependencies write npm install in terminal and press enter.
5. To run the project use npm start command.

Features:
1. There is an admin, volunteer and donor dashboard. Admin has access to all features, including user management, donation requests, and content management whereas volunteers create and manage donation requests.
2. A Give Fund page available where users can donate money. I did it by using Stripe Payment.
3. A Pagination feature has been added in some pages and also a donor can register, view donation requests, respond to them, and maintain his own profile.
