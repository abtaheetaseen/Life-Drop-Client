JavaScript and React are mainly used for client-side development, and for server-side scripting, Node.js and MongoDB are used. Donors can find blood donation requests in their local region and get in touch with the recipients.

To run locally:
1. Click the green "Code" button and copy the URL.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run this command: git clone <repo url>
4. To install dependencies use npm install command.
5. To run the project use npm start command.

Features:
1. There is an admin, volunteer and donor dashboard. Admin has access to all features, including user management, donation requests, and content management whereas volunteers create and manage donation requests.
2. A Give Fund page available where users can donate money. I did it by using Stripe Payment.
3. A Pagination feature has been added in some pages and also a donor can register, view donation requests, respond to them, and maintain his own profile.
